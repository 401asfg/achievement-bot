# Discord Custom Achievement Bot
A Discord bot that allows users to bestow permenant achievements to other users.

## Note:
A user's acheivement data is saved to the bot instance itself. Meaning, if an achievement is added to a user in one server, that same achievement can be viewed in an another server if that server uses the same instance of the bot.
